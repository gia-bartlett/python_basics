input("What is your name? ") = ask the user for an input

Comments are annotations to code used to make it easier to understand.  
They don't affect how code is run.  
In Python, a comment is created by inserting an octothorpe (otherwise known as a number sign or hash symbol: #). All text after it on that line is ignored.  
```python
x = 365
y = 7
# this is a comment

print(x % y) # find the remainder
# print (x // y)
# another comment
# this will print 1
```
Docstrings (documentation strings) serve a similar purpose to comments, as they are designed to explain code.   However, they are more specific and have a different syntax.  They are created by putting a multiline string containing an explanation of the function below the function's first line.  
```python
def shout(word):
  """
  Print a word with an
  exclamation mark following it.
  """
  print(word + "!")
    
shout("halp")
# prints halp!
```
